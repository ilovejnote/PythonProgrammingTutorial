# To understand why in math we use "S = π*r*r" ; And To calculate 1 to 100 we use "∑". in math call it abstract
# In Python we call this math method named function. In this way we don't need to aways write 3.14 * x * x, just use area_of_circle(x),once
# python surport function and inside python there already have lots functions. you can use these functions directly.
# In pythone function is one of method of abstract.
# For example use abs() we can check it first form command line of interactive "help(abs)"
# >>> help(abs)
#Help on built-in function abs in module builtins:
#
#abs(x, /)
#    Return the absolute value of the argument.

#>>> 
print(abs(100), abs(-20))
